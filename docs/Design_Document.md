# Design Document: AI-Driven Dynamic Cyber Range Platform

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the design of the "AI Agent Driven Dynamic Attack-Defense Deduction Cyber Range Platform" for the Challenge Cup: Jiebang Guashuai competition. The platform aims to address the limitations of traditional cyber ranges by leveraging artificial intelligence to create a more realistic, adaptive, and effective training environment.

## 2. Overall System Architecture
Our platform will be built upon four interconnected, AI-driven pillars, forming a cohesive, self-improving AI ecosystem. A central orchestrator (or "Gatekeeper") will manage interactions between components and the live cyber range environment to ensure reliability and security. All data will flow into a centralized data and logging pipeline to fuel evaluation and AI feedback loops.

[Conceptual Diagram Placeholder: Imagine a diagram with boxes for User Interface, Orchestrator, Dynamic Scenario Generation, Intelligent Attack Simulation, Adaptive Defense Decision-Making, Automated Exercise Evaluation, Cyber Range Environment, and Central Data & Logging Pipeline. Arrows should show communication between them, and feedback loops from Evaluation back to Scenario Generation, and self-learning loops for Attack and Defense Agents.]

* Feedback Loops:
    * Automated Exercise Evaluation informs Dynamic Scenario Generation (e.g., creating exercises to address specific defender skill gaps).
    * Human defender successes/failures are learned by the Adaptive Defense Decision-Making agent.
    * Intelligent Attack Simulation agent adapts its strategies based on success/failure.
    * This creates a co-evolutionary dynamic, enhancing sophistication.

## 3. Core Pillars: Detailed Design (High-Level)

### 3.1. Dynamic Scenario Generation
* Purpose: To create complex, multi-dimensional, and real-time adaptive training environments.
* Key Components:
    * IaC Framework Integration (Terraform/Docker): For automated provisioning of network topologies, services, and applications.
    * Generative AI Module (LLMs/GANs): For creating high-fidelity, interactive content like convincing phishing emails, malicious websites, or deepfake media for social engineering attacks.
    * AI Control Plane: Monitors exercise state and triggers real-time environmental adjustments (e.g., introducing zero-days or escalating intensity if defenses are successful).
* API Interactions (Conceptual):
    * Inputs: Initial scenario parameters (e.g., business type, complexity), real-time feedback from environment, skill profiles from Evaluation.
    * Outputs: Deployed environment configuration, generated scenario content (emails, URLs), real-time environment state updates.

### 3.2. Intelligent Attack Simulation (Attack AI Agent)
* Purpose: To simulate sophisticated, multi-stage, autonomous attack chains.
* Key Components:
    * Agent Logic/Orchestration Framework (LangChain/AutoGen): Provides the reasoning, planning, and tool-use capabilities.
    * Cybersecurity Tool Integration (e.g., Nmap, ZAP, TARS): Allows the agent to use actual penetration testing tools.
    * Goal-Based Reasoning Engine: Drives the agent towards compromise objectives.
    * MITRE ATT&CK Mapper: Guides the selection and sequencing of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).
    * Generative AI for Recon/Social Engineering: Crafts personalized attacks based on simulated target research.
* API Interactions (Conceptual):
    * Inputs: Current environment state, defined attack goals.
    * Outputs: Actions executed (TTPs), observed outcomes, agent decision logs.

### 3.3. Adaptive Defense Decision-Making (Defense AI Agent)
* Purpose: To function as an autonomous blue team, analyzing threats and optimizing defensive strategies in real-time.
* Key Components:
    * Behavioral Analytics Engine (UEBA-like): Establishes baseline "normal" activity and detects deviations.
    * Threat Intelligence Integration: Potentially consumes real-time threat feeds.
    * Automated Response Module: Executes actions like blocking IPs, patching vulnerabilities, isolating endpoints, or terminating processes.
    * Predictive Analytics (Future): Forecasts attacks based on patterns to proactively harden defenses.
    * Polymorphic Defense Module (Advanced): Intelligently reconfigures attack surface.
* API Interactions (Conceptual):
    * Inputs: Real-time security events (logs, network traffic, alerts), current environment state.
    * Outputs: Defensive actions taken, analysis results, agent decision logs.

### 3.4. Automated Exercise Evaluation
* Purpose: To provide objective, quantitative assessment of exercise outcomes and participant capabilities.
* Key Components:
    * Centralized Logging Pipeline: Ingests all data from attack, defense, and human actions.
    * Quantitative Scoring Model: Calculates metrics like financial impact, time-to-detection/remediation, and systems compromised.
    * Skill Profiling Engine: Maps logged actions to cybersecurity competency frameworks (e.g., NIST/NICE) to build detailed "skill profiles" for participants.
    * Report Generation: Creates comprehensive evaluation reports with actionable guidance.
* API Interactions (Conceptual):
    * Inputs: All collected logs (attack, defense, human), final environment state.
    * Outputs: Evaluation reports, detailed skill profiles, improvement recommendations.
